This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

it uses model text-davinchi 3 and you need to use the api key on the open ai web , example on the .env file : OPENAI_API_KEY='string key goes here'

##stack used

-NextJS 13 (it using appDir feature) just for learning purpose
-openai npm module
-tailwind css
-axios (for fetch request)

## Getting Started

Please don't forget to run npm install before u start the dev server
and ... dunno if u forget .... .env file dont go to github repo so u must make ur own

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
